Analysis

For training and testing the model we created, we used Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier. 

Some shortcomings that we faced with this model of ours is that, if we had no occurrences of a class label and a certain attribute value together, then the frequency-based probability estimate was always zero. Given the Naive-Bayes' conditional independence assumption, when all the probabilities are multiplied we got zero and this affected the following probability estimate.
This problem happens when we are drawing samples from a population and the drawn vectors are not fully representative of the population. Lagrange correction and other schemes have been proposed to avoid this undesirable situation.
